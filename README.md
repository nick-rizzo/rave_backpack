# LED Controller for Wearables
## Overview
This project is designed to be a controller for WS2812b style LED strips aimed to be embedded into a backpack.

### Getting started 
The project should be self contained, all files in this repo are needed to run the project on a STM32F446RET microcontroller

Included is a Python script which I used to generate a font from a 7x10 pixel per letter image.
